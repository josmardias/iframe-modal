# iframe-modal
_Work in progress_

This project shows how to make an iframe act like a modal.

The iframe is centralized vertically and horizontally.
There is a transparent mask behind the modal (within the iframe).
It handles ios8 "position: fixed" issue.

Tested on iOS8 (both Safari and Chrome), android 4.4.4 (Chrome) and Linux/MacOS (Chrome and Safari)
